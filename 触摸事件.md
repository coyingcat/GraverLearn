A window delivers touch events to a gesture recognizer before it delivers them to the hit-tested view attached to the gesture recognizer. Generally, if a gesture recognizer analyzes the stream of touches in a multi-touch sequence and doesn’t recognize its gesture, the view receives the full complement of touches. If a gesture recognizer recognizes its gesture, the remaining touches for the view are cancelled. The usual sequence of actions in gesture recognition follows a path determined by default values of the cancelsTouchesInView, delaysTouchesBegan, delaysTouchesEnded properties:





cancelsTouchesInView—If a gesture recognizer recognizes its gesture, it unbinds the remaining touches of that gesture from their view (so the window won’t deliver them). The window cancels the previously delivered touches with a (touchesCancelled(_:with:)) message. If a gesture recognizer doesn’t recognize its gesture, the view receives all touches in the multi-touch sequence.
